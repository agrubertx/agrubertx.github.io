[Data-Driven-ROM](https://github.com/agrubertx/Data-Driven-ROM).  A (mostly clean) Python implementation of our autoencoder-based ROMs.

[New-NLL](https://github.com/agrubertx/New-NLL).  A clean Python implementation of our modified NLL algorithm.

[Quasiconformal Remeshing](https://github.com/agrubertx/MyFEMuS/tree/anthony/applications/Conformal/ex8).  A messy research implementation of our quasiconformal remeshing algorithm.

[p-Willmore Flow](https://github.com/agrubertx/MyFEMuS/tree/anthony/applications/Willmore/WillmoreSurface/ex1). A messy research implementation of our p-Willmore flow algorithm.

[burgers.py](/files/code/burgers.py).  A Python program which computes solutions to the 1-D inviscid Burgers' equation, along with their sensitivities.

[Active Manifolds](https://github.com/bridgesra/active-manifold-icml2019-code).  Python code necessary to run the Active Manifolds algorithm.

[AM Examples](https://github.com/agrubertx/AMv2/blob/master/ipynb%20files/Examples_toy_and_MHD.ipynb).  A Jupyter notebook outlining some basic applications of Active Manifolds. Requires the "Active Manifolds" code above and an installation of [Active Subspaces](https://github.com/paulcon/active_subspaces) to run the notebook locally.
