I am a differential geometer working on surface theory and its applications to biology, physics, and data science. I received my PhD from Texas Tech University under the guidance of [Prof. Magdalena Toda](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~mtoda/), with co-advisors [Prof. Hung Tran](https://www.math.uci.edu/~hungtt1/) and [Prof. Eugenio Aulisa](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~eaulisa/).

My research interests include surface immersions, curvature functionals, variational calculus, computational and discrete geometry, integrability problems, conformal geometry, and geometric flows.

Modeling the p-Willmore Flow of Surfaces
------
![image-left](/images/Modelfrontpage.png){: .align-left} Geometric flows are beautiful and powerful tools for prescribing a change in the geometry of a surface.
This project is a computational study of the p-Willmore flow, with the aim to develop a finite-element model that is amenable to geometric constraints on surface area and enclosed volume.

Active Manifolds: Geometric Data Analysis for Dimension Reduction
------
![image-left](/images/AMfrontpage.png){: .align-left} Scientists and engineers are frequently presented with mathematical models that are difficult to analyze due to their reliance on a large number of parameters. This project is inspired by the Active Subspaces idea of [Paul Constantine](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7x-Q4Y8AAAAJ&hl=en), and provides an algorithm which reduces the dimension of an unknown function to 1 regardless of the size of the original input space.

Curvature Functionals and p-Willmore Energy
------
![image-left](/images/virus_end.png){: .align-left}Functional involving surface curvature are important across a wide variety of disciplines, and their minima are frequently representative of physically relevant structures, such as biomembranes or interfaces between materials.  This project involves a variational characterization of such functionals, with particular interest given to a generalization of the Willmore functional. (Joint with [Magdalena Toda](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~mtoda/), [Hung Tran](https://www.math.uci.edu/~hungtt1/), and [Álvaro Pámpano](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2239-2247).
